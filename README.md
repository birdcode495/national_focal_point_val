# NATIONAL FOCAL POINT VALLE DEL CAUCA

## Política Nacional para la Gestión Integral de la
Biodiversidad y sus Servicios Ecosistémicos (PNGIBSE)
(MADS et al., 2012).

The country's biodiversity must be understood
light of its interaction with society. This approach
assumed by PNGIBSE has given rise to six axes
thematic topics aimed at promoting and managing the
natural wealth of the country.

Under these statements, PNGIBSE proposes the following six thematic axes:

1. Biodiversity, conservation and care of nature.
2. Biodiversity, governance and creation of public value.
3. Biodiversity, economic development and quality of life.
4. Biodiversity, knowledge management, technology and information.
5. Biodiversity, risk management and provision of ecosystem services.
6. Biodiversity, co-responsibility and global commitments.

In that sense, this proposal to develop a comprehensive spatial database regarding the
issue of diagnosis of the country's biodiversity, seeks to make a contribution to integrate
technological resources that contribute to making accredited sources of information visible
regarding georeferenced records of the presence of flora and fauna species in the
different territories. This database can provide a useful framework for the formation of
citizenship on the issue of biological diversity, integrating elements of
STEM methodology, to design and consolidate an interdisciplinary model of non-formal education with
biodiversity content, software programming and trilingualism that propose to the
citizens of Colombia a data bank through which a formal construction process can begin
cultural and popular systematic and organized knowledge of biodiversity resources
that collects the popular knowledge of this topic and organizes it in a Project with scope
territorial at the national level, which in its implementation process serves as an educational model
replicable on a global scale.
