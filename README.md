# NATIONAL FOCAL POINT VALLE DEL CAUCA

 Política Nacional para la Gestión Integral de la
Biodiversidad y sus Servicios Ecosistémicos (PNGIBSE)
(MADS et al., 2012).

The country's biodiversity must be understood
light of its interaction with society. This approach
assumed by PNGIBSE has given rise to six axes
thematic topics aimed at promoting and managing the
natural wealth of the country.

Under these statements, PNGIBSE proposes the following six thematic axes:

1. Biodiversity, conservation and care of nature.
2. Biodiversity, governance and creation of public value.
3. Biodiversity, economic development and quality of life.
4. Biodiversity, knowledge management, technology and information.
5. Biodiversity, risk management and provision of ecosystem services.
6. Biodiversity, co-responsibility and global commitments.

In that sense, this proposal to develop a comprehensive spatial database, regarding the
issue of diagnosis of the country's biodiversity, seeks to make a contribution to integrate
technological resources that contribute to making accredited sources of information visible
regarding of georeferenced records of the presence of flora and fauna species in the
different territories. The principal source of data is, of course, the databank of GBIF API.
This database can provide a useful framework for the formation of citizenship on the issue of 
biological diversity, integrating elements of STEM methodology, to design and consolidate an 
interdisciplinary model of non-formal education with biodiversity content, software programming
and trilingualism that propose to the citizens of Colombia a data bank through which a formal 
construction process can begin, for a cultural and popular systematic and organized knowledge of 
biodiversity resources that can take place and  collects the popular knowledge of this topic and 
organizes it, in a Project with a territorial scale at the national level, which in its implementation 
process, serves as an educational model replicable on a global scale.

The example model presented is implemented based on the set of flora and fauna biodiversity data reported by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, for the territory for the Valle del Cauca region, in which the city of Cali, which is the headquarters of the Conference of the Parties COP-16, to be held between October 21 and November 1, 2024 is located.
